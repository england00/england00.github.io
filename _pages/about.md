Hi, I’m Luca.
I’m an AI Engineer working on large-scale Generative AI systems, with a strong focus on LLM-based architectures, agentic pipelines, and production-ready AI solutions.

My background in Computer Engineering and Artificial Intelligence has given me a solid foundation in software systems, model evaluation, and reliable ML engineering. During my studies, I also gained international experience in multidisciplinary environments at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, which strongly influenced the way I approach complex and long-term projects.

I started my career in applied research, contributing to computer vision and robotics systems, and I currently work as an AI Engineer on Generative AI initiatives, focusing on scalable architectures, automated evaluation, and robust deployment of LLM-based systems.

Outside of work, I’m drawn to activities that combine focus, discipline, and creativity — such as photography, outdoor sports, music, and reading — which naturally shape the way I think about problem-solving and continuous improvement.

A detailed overview of my experience, education, and projects is available in my [résumé](https://england00.github.io/cv/).
