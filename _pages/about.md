Hi, I’m Luca, an AI Engineer who works with large-scale Generative AI systems. I have a strong focus on LLM-based architectures, agentic pipelines, and production-ready AI solutions.

My background in Computer Engineering and Artificial Intelligence has given me a solid foundation in software systems, model evaluation, and reliable ML engineering. During my studies, I also gained international experience in a multidisciplinary environment at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, which strongly influenced the way I approach complex and long-term projects.

I started my career in applied research, contributing to computer vision and robotics systems, and I currently work as an AI Engineer on Generative AI initiatives. My current role focusses on scalable architectures, automated evaluation, and robust deployment of LLM-based systems.

Outside of work, I’m drawn to activities that require focus, discipline, and creativity, such as photography, outdoor sports, music, and reading. These hobbies are enjoyable and stress-relieving while also influencing the way I think about problem-solving and continuous improvement.

A detailed overview of my experience, education, and projects is available in my [résumé](https://england00.github.io/cv/).
