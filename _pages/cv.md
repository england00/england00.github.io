Work Experience
======

**AI Engineer**  
[Adeptic Reply (Reply S.p.A.)](https://www.reply.com/adeptic-reply/en) – Milan (Hybrid), Italy  
May 2025 – Present

- Designed and implemented a Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) pipeline for LLM-as-a-Judge systems, including rubric engineering, reward modeling, and automated grader evaluation (~10% improvement over SFT baselines)  
- Built an agentic LLM optimization pipeline using genetic prompt optimization and adaptive in-context learning (10–15% performance gains)  
- Evaluated training stacks for Continual Pre-Training and Post-Training workflows in collaboration with a leading Italian medical research center  
- Engineered a modular Python benchmarking pipeline for foundation models on dataset-driven agent tasks

**Software Developer – Research Grant**  
[Hipert S.r.l. – DIEF UNIMORE](https://www.hipert.it/) – Mantova, Italy  
April 2022 – September 2022

- Selected and validated vision system architectures for robotic pick-and-place tasks  
- Developed a 6D object pose estimation pipeline based on point cloud convergence from depth sensing  
- Contributed to integration of computer vision, 3D perception, and robotic control in a collaborative robot (cobot) environment
