Work Experience
======

**AI Engineer**  
[Adeptic Reply (Reply S.p.A.)](https://www.reply.com/adeptic-reply/en) – Milan (Hybrid), Italy  
May 2025 – Present

Working within the IPCEI – Generative AI initiative, an EU-funded large-scale program for advanced AI system development.

Key Responsibilities & Contributions:
- Designed and implemented a Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) pipeline for LLM-as-a-Judge systems with rubric engineering, reward modeling, and automated grader evaluation, improving judgment accuracy by ~10% over SFT baselines
- Built an agentic LLM optimization pipeline using genetic prompt optimization and adaptive in-context learning, achieving 10–15% performance gains
- Evaluated training stacks for Continual Pre-Training and Post-Training workflows in collaboration with a leading Italian medical research center
- Engineered a modular Python pipeline for benchmarking foundation models on dataset-driven agent tasks
- Drove technical reviews and defined optimization strategies for pre-existing agentic AI systems, enhancing scalability and evaluation robustness

Tools & Technologies:
- Languages & Frameworks: Python, FastAPI, UV
- LLM & GenAI: OpenAI Platform & SDK, LangGraph, MCP
- Evaluation & Optimization: Langfuse, GEPA, Unsloth
- Infrastructure: AWS, Docker
